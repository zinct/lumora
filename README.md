  <p align="center">
     Lumora is a fully on-chain eco-action platform that empowers users to submit and verify real-world environmental projects through community voting. Verified actions are rewarded with $LUM tokens (ICRC1/2), while NFT achievements (ICRC7), AI chatbot support, face recognition, and storage canister for image proof enhance the experience with transparency and trust.
